# Behat Sitemap Extension

## Synopsis
Behat Sitemap Extension provides a way to smoke/sanity test all site pages by getting the URLs from `/sitemap.xml` and visiting them to see if we get 200 response.

## Motivation
- Provide a simple way to start with behat
- With minimal effort, sanity check all pages.


## Installation

### Quick start

Clone this repository and then run:

```bash
export BEHAT_PARAMS='{"extensions":{"Behat\\MinkExtension":{"base_url":"http://localhost"}}}'; bin/behat
```

> Note: Replace `http://localhost` with your site URL.

### Run for multiple sites

Add a CSV file of site URLs and tags to run with (Only available tag with this extension is "@smoke") and run:

```bash
./script/run-test.sh
```
### Using Tags

Using tags can be done by including it at the end of your query: EG:

export BEHAT_PARAMS='{"extensions":{"Behat\\MinkExtension":{"base_url":"http://localhost"}}}'; bin/behat *--tags=@smoke*

Add the following to just check if the sitemap.xml can be found or if it 404's.

```bash
--tags=@smoke
```

Add the following to run an immediate check if the urls within the sitemap resolve correctly

```bash
--tags=@url
```
